# Vanilla Elements

A Minimalistic Custom Elements Helper, with optional polyfill included, compatible with every evergreen browser.

The default module export, which is ~0.4K, works natively in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, but if you target Safari / WebKit too, you can use the `vanilla-elements/poly` variant, which is ~2K, and it includes proper features detection, leaving Chrome, Edge, and Firefox 100% native.

```js
import {define, HTML} from 'vanilla-elements';

// generic components ... or
define('my-comp', class extends HTML.Element {
  // native Custom Elements definition
});

// ... builtins extend simplified
define('my-div', class extends HTML.Div {
  // native Custom Elements definition
});

class MyFooter extends HTML.Footer {}
define('my-footer', MyFooter);

document.body.appendChild(new MyFooter);
```


## API

  * the `define(name:string, Class):Class` automatically recognize the right way to define each component, either generic elements or built-ins.
  * the `HTML` namespace contains all available HTML classes from the browser, with shortcuts such as `Div`, `Main`, `Footer`, `A`, `P`, and everything else.

**[Live Example](https://codepen.io/WebReflection/pen/jOmVVQQ?editors=0010)**

```js
import {define, HTML} from 'vanilla-elements';
import {render, html} from 'uhtml';

define('h2-greetings', class extends HTML.H2 {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.html = (...args) => render(this, html(...args));
    this.render();
  }
  render() {
    this.html`Hello Vanilla Elements ðŸ‘‹`;
  }
});

render(document.body, html`
  <h2 is="h2-greetings" />
`);
```


## F.A.Q.

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is the benefit of using this module?</strong></summary>
  <div>

The feature detection for builtin extends is both ugly and not really Web friendly.

One could simply include [@ungap/custom-elements](https://github.com/ungap/custom-elements#readme) polyfill on top of each page and call it a day, but I wanted to have only the missing part, builtin extends, embedded in a module, and this helper is perfect for that purpose.

On top of that, I really don't like the ugly dance needed to register builtin extends, so that having a tiny utility that simplifies their definition seemed to be about right.

```js
// without this module
customElements.define(
  'my-div',
  class extends HTMLDivElement {},
  {extends: 'div'}
);

// with this module
import {define, HTML} from 'vanilla-elements';
define('my-div', class extends HTML.Div {});
```

As we can see, the definition through this module is more compact, elegant, and natural, than its native counter-part, and that's about it.

  <summary><strong>Why isn't the polyfill included by default?</strong></summary>
  <div>

The only browser that needs a polyfill for builtin extends is Safari / WebKit, and it needs it only for builtin extends.

However, not everyone develop for the Web, and not everyone uses builtin extends, so the sane default is to provide a minimal utility that simplifies custom elements registration that works out of the box in every modern browser.

Whenever the target needs to include Safari / WebKit, and builtin extends are used, it takes nothing to switch import from `vanilla-elements` to `vanilla-elements/poly`.

  <summary><strong>What are the exports?</strong></summary>
  <div>

For development usage, through bundlers and similar tools:

  * `vanilla-elements` points at the [main.js](./esm/main.js), and it doesn't include the polyfill
  * `vanilla-elements/poly` points at the generated [index.js](./index.js) file, and include the polyfill after feature detection

For CDN usage in the wild:

  * the `//unpkg.com/vanilla-elements` CDN points at the minified [es.js](./es.js) which *includes* the polyfill (it's the minified index)
  * for `skypack.dev` minified file, you can point at the `es.js` file directly: [//cdn.skypack.dev/vanilla-elements/es.js](https://cdn.skypack.dev/vanilla-elements/es.js)
